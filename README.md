# programming test

## Welcome to Aequam Capital’s programming test !

### Summary

This test is designed to evaluate your Python programming skills. It should take you about 2 hours, although time spent is not an evaluation criterion.

### Instructions

We ask you to:

*   Fork this repository to your own Github account ;
*   Commit your own solution (of the original files, only `exercise.py` should be modified but you can add as many additional files / documents as you want in your commit)
*   Reply to your interviewer with a link to your forked repository once you’re done. **Do not create a Pull Request** as this is a public repository.


The folder `data` contains two files : `data/data.csv` contains the _Eurostoxx 50_ total return price history and this is the financial series you should use to test your functions ; `data/output.csv` contains the same series as well as the expected output for the `macd` function you should create in `exercise.py`.

The most important file is `exercise.py` : it contains some functions you have to fill in and, along with the requested behaviour of the described function. 
You are not expected to know these ratios / functions and it’s part of the exercise to see how you go about learning & implementing your solution for each function.

### Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the following aspects:

*   **Functionality**: your code should produce the expected output without execution error ;
*   **Readability**: your code should be easily readable for standard users. Feel free to comment or add documentation to your code ;
*   **Efficiency**: your code should perform the requested task in an efficient way, without doing unnecessary calculations.

If you unable to complete any of the questions, provide explanations of what issues you encoutered and how you tried to solve it.

Best of luck,
